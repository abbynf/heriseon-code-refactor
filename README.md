# horiseon-code-refactor
I have refactored the code for the Horiseon main page to increase accessibility. This optimizes thes site for search engines, which increases the exposure of the company. I have included HTML semantics, added alt attributes to all of the images, and re-arranged the headings so they will appear in a logical order.
